# ChatGPTStockPredicter
A tool in progress to extract sentiment out of news articles using GPT API and predict stock price with it. 

The idea is to gather a good enough collection of news articles from reputible news resources on Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft, just to then do a sentiment analysis on them. The aim is to use these scores to predict these stocks' prices from one day before via a depp learning model.
